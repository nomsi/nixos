### Personal nix config
Usually I upload to my private git but I should keep my nixos configuration adventure archived publicly.

Interesting tidbits:
- System 1 (nixy):
  - Has 2 2070 SUPERs for VFIO GPU Passthrough (For VR mainly)
  - Is getting a massive upgrade this year but will keep the dual GPU setup
- System 2 (surfacey)
  - Generic Microsoft Surface Pro 7
  - Surface Kernel in NixOS is a pain to compile on hardware
- System 3 (decky)
  - Steam Deck
  - ... *coming soon?*
- System 4 (homelaby)
  - Home Server. Not yet built
- System 5 (servery)
  - Need time to migrate but will be adding it.

This is my todo list now basically. Ignore the fact that it's all simplistic, and I have yet to make any overlays or anything yet.
